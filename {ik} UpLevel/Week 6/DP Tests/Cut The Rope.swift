// # Cut The Rope
/*
Given a rope, cut it into parts maximizing the product of their lengths.

## Example
```
{
"n": 4
}
```

Output: `4`

Length of the rope is 4.
All ways it can be cut into parts: 1+3, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1, 2+2, 2+1+1.
Among these, 2+2 cut makes for the greatest product: 2*2=4.

## Notes

Return an integer which equals to the maximum possible product of the given ropeâ€™s parts.
Constraints:

2 <= length of the rope <= 94
You have to cut at least once.
Length of the rope, lengths of all parts are all positive integers.

for every possible cut (of length c), compute:
	- stop cutting: c*(l-c)
	- keep cutting: best(l-c)

formula:
	
	bestSolution(l) = max(c*(l-c), c*bestSolution(l-c))
