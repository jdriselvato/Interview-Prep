// Segregate Even And Odd Numbers - class discussion

/*

# Ways to solve it:

	1. Use two extra arrays (two aux) and merge
	2. Partition the array into two parts
	3. Inplace swapping
	4. Counting approach, count the number of even and number odd. <- this seems way overkill because you're making your partition in an array but you still need to scan the array for even or odd and place the value in the array.
