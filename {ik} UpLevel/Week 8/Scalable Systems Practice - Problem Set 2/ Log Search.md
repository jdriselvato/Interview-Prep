# Log Search

[This one may have been done in the class. Whatever the instructor taught you supersedes the following]

Design a log-searching web application

- Thousands of app servers are writing application logs
- Ability for a user to use a web interface to search in real time across all app servers
- I am looking for core pieces that you would need to build for this platform so that your solution scales
- It should be scalable, but also "near" realtime
