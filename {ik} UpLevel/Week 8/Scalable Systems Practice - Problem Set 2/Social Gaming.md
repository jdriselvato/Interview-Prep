# Social Gaming

[This problem may have been done in the class. Whatever the instructor taught you supersedes the following]

Design a social gaming site like Playfish or Farmville

- At its peak, Playfish had 10MM daily active users on its games. The games are primarily played on social platforms like Facebook. (EA bought Playfish for $300MM, but that's besides the point)
- Design the system with social gaming in mind. : ability to build multiple different types of social games, at scale low latency on client is important
