Design Twitter User/Follower model

- Twitter has users and users have followers

- How would you scale this system when there are certain users that have millions of followers whereas certain users only have a few (<100) users?
- How would you use the Twitter user/follower system to build a userâ€™s home timeline? Account for celebrities who have millions of followers where their tweets should reach all followers in near real time.
