# Recommendation System

[This problem may have been done in the class. Whatever the instructor taught you supersedes the following]

Design a movie recommendation system like Netflix

- Design a recommendation system for recommending relevant content to users on Netflix
- Propose a couple of algorithms/models would you use for building a recommendation system [Hint: use a collaborative filtering algorithm]
- Assume we have several billion item ratings from members
- Each item in our catalog has rich metadata such as actors, director, genre, parental rating, or reviews
- Focus on main use cases : cold start problem, displaying recommendations to users
