# (e)Commerce Website

[This problem may have been done in the class. Whatever the instructor taught you supersedes the following]

Design an eCommerce website

This question is no different from designing a general website that can handle scale. There is nothing fancy about eCommerce.

Most important thing to clarify with the interviewer here, is which direction they are expecting:

- Do they expect an object modeling design?
- Do they expect you to do architectural scaling e.g. discussing how you'll maintain availability?

- If it is the latter, then it's a very standard answer like that of designing a cache i.e. sharding and the discussions should focus on availability with eventual consistency. 
- If it's object modeling, then your answer should focus on modeling entities like Products, Buyers, Sellers, etc. 

Reading pointers:

No good ones. Not required either. It's just old wine in a new bottle.
