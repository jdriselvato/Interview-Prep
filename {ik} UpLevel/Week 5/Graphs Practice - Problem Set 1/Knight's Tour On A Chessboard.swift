// Knight's Tour On A Chessboard

/* You are given a chessboard with rows rows and cols columns and a knight - that moves like in normal chess - located at the start_row-th row and start_col-th column. The knight needs to reach the position at the end_row-th row and end_col-th column.

Find minimum number of moves that knight needs to make to get from starting position to ending position.

start_row, start_col, end_row and end_col are all zero-indexed.

Example

{
"rows": 5,
"cols": 5,
"start_row": 0,
"start_col": 0,
"end_row": 4,
"end_col": 1
}
Output:

3

3 moves to reach from (0, 0) to (4, 1):
(0, 0) → (1, 2) → (3, 3) → (4, 1).

Notes

If it is not possible to reach from starting position to ending position, then return -1.
Constraints:

1 <= rows * cols <= 105
0 <= start_row, end_row < rows
0 <= start_col, end_col < cols
