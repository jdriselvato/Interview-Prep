// Diameter Of A Binary Tree

// Given a binary tree, find its diameter.

// Notes

// Diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes of the tree.
// Length between any two nodes is equal to the number of edges traversed to reach one node from the other.
// Constraints:

// 1 <= number of nodes in the given tree <= 105
// 0 <= node value < number of nodes
// Node values are unique
